# Windows Keyboard Layout - United States (Italian)
Windows offers a keyboard layout called "United States (International)" that makes typing accented special characters more convenient in order, for example, to write Italian words like `perché`, `più`, `però`, etc. 
This layout marks some key as special keys called "dead keys", like the apostrophe `'` and quote `'`, which are used to add accents to some characters like `a`, `e`, `i`, `o` and `u`.
In order to just input the apostrophe `'` and quote `'` characters you have to press the key and press `SPACE`, which can be very time consuming while writing, for example the words `i'll`, `don't`, etc.

This repo allows you to install a customized layout to make writing in ITA-ENG easier.

- Press the key to get `\``
- Press the key to get `'`
- Press the key to get `"`
- Press the key to get `~`
- Press the key to get `^`
- `ALTGR` + `5` to get `€`
- `AltGr` + `a` to get `à`
- `AltGr` + `e` to get `é`
- `AltGr` + `w` to get `è` (I decided to use `w` instead of `e` because it's near the `e` key and `w` has no accent in Italian)
- `AltGr` + `i` to get `ì`
- `AltGr` + `o` to get `ò`
- `AltGr` + `u` to get `ù`
- `AltGr` + `Shift` + `a` to get `À`
- `AltGr` + `Shift` + `e` to get `É`
- `AltGr` + `Shift` + `w` to get `È`
- `AltGr` + `Shift` + `i` to get `Ì`
- `AltGr` + `Shift` + `o` to get `Ò`
- `AltGr` + `Shift` + `u` to get `Ù`

To compose accented characters with other characters, you can use the following combinations:
- `AltGr` + `\`` + `a` = `à`
- `AltGr` + `\`` + `e` = `è`
- `AltGr` + `\`` + `i` = `ì`
- `AltGr` + `\`` + `o` = `ò`
- `AltGr` + `\`` + `u` = `ù`
- `AltGr` + `'` + `a` = `á`
- `AltGr` + `'` + `e` = `é`
- `AltGr` + `'` + `i` = `í`
- `AltGr` + `'` + `o` = `ó`
- `AltGr` + `'` + `u` = `ú`
